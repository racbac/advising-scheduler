# CMSC 331 Project 2

## Project Collaborators
Felipe Bastos
Rachel Brackert
Travis Earley
Nathaniel Fuller
Colin Ganley

## Tentitative Due Date
2016-Dec-13

## Project Workflow
Github will be used as the repository manager. Five collaborators work on their own branches to ensure project integrity. When changes are sufficiently finalized, these branches will be merged with master. Each collaborator has his or her own working branch rather than a feature branch.

Please run git pull periodically to pull in changes to master and avoid merge conflicts. When a personal branch is sufficiently modified to include the project changes a pull request will be open. This means that all code submitted is open to peer review. Once appropriate changes are made and with approval, the branch will be merged into master.

## Project Description

The project files were given by another group within the class. These will be reviewed and modified per the group's discussion as indicated in the project description on Blackboard.
