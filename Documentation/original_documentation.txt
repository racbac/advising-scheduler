                                       Project 1 Documentation
 Main Idea: Build an advising website (broken down into an advisor interface and a student interface) that has a feature which replaces the paper documents that advisors currently have students fill out by hand.

Database:
1. Advisor Tables  
- advisors_majors: columns are the id, and each of the eight majors, which store     Boolean values depending on if the advisor can advise that major or not 
- advisor_appts: columns are the id, date, each of the eighteen time blocks (saved as  Boolean values), and the corresponding location each of the eighteen time blocks (saved as text values)	  
-advisor_info: columns are id, username, password (saved with md5 hash), lname, fname, office, and email 
  2.
